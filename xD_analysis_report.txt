EXPECTED DANGER (xD) ANALYSIS REPORT
============================================================

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY:
----------------------------------------
1. Danger passes identified: passes within 15s of shots 
2. Logistic regression with non-linear features for shot probability 
3. Linear regression for goal probability 
4. Expected Danger (xD) = P(shot) × P(goal) 
5. Players ranked by xD per 90 vs danger passes per 90 by position 

KEY FINDINGS:
----------------------------------------

FORWARD ANALYSIS:
  Rank correlation: 0.79
  W. Alves: Higher xD rank (1) than danger pass rank (130) - creates high-quality chances
  M. Mane: Higher xD rank (7) than danger pass rank (130) - creates high-quality chances

MIDFIELDER ANALYSIS:
  Rank correlation: 0.80
  H. Armstrong: Higher xD rank (2) than danger pass rank (158) - creates high-quality chances
  O. Aluko: Higher xD rank (12) than danger pass rank (158) - creates high-quality chances

DEFENDER ANALYSIS:
  Rank correlation: 0.87
  J. Meghoma: Higher xD rank (14) than danger pass rank (178) - creates high-quality chances
  M. Targett: Higher xD rank (15) than danger pass rank (178) - creates high-quality chances

GOALKEEPER ANALYSIS:
  Rank correlation: -0.17
  Note: Low correlation suggests xD captures different aspects than just danger pass count
  V. Jaroš: Higher xD rank (1) than danger pass rank (40) - creates high-quality chances
  Neto: Higher xD rank (6) than danger pass rank (40) - creates high-quality chances
